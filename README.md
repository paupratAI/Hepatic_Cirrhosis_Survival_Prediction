Many cells are completely commented out to prevent them from being executed. This is simply to significantly reduce execution time if the entire file is to be run, as these are codes that have a high computational cost. Therefore, if you wish to execute them, you just need to uncomment the respective cell.

You can also see that many plt.savefig() lines are commented out. This is done to avoid errors, as these lines of code were used to save time by storing the different plots in a subfolder named 'plots'. However, if this subfolder does not exist when the same code is executed from another computer, it would cause an error. That is why they are commented out. If you wish to execute them, the 'plots' subfolder must exist, and it should also contain various subfolders, which were useful for organizing the different graphics included in the report.
